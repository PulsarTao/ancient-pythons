I searched the Windows FAQ's and finally gleaned enough information to
write system() the "right" way under Windows.  The new system() function
really returns the exit status of the child process (left shifted
to be compatible with UNIX), and not an assumed successful completion
status.

system() requires toolhelp.dll, which is only available on Windows 3.1;
However, toolhelp may be freely distributed with Python for people who are
clinging to Windows 3.0. (A Zipped toolhelp.dll could be put on the
Python FTP site, and people who don't have it should download
toolhelp.dll and put it in their /windows/system directory.)

I had to change the build procedures somewhat because system()
requires different flags (-GA,-GEd instead of -Mq), and to link
toolhelp.lib.
